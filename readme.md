  			Welcome! 
  
  	My name is Pawel Pelech and I have created this website to showcase my work in fields of amateur photography and filmmaking. Most of my 
 	work was done as a pure hobby, however I do have some succesful commericial work under my belt. There is information about me, who I am and 
 	what I do. In gear  page section all the aspects of my equipment are covered. Lastly for potential customers contact page is beeing created. 
 	A links to social media are provided for further possibilty of cooperation.

 	Technoligies used:

	1. HTML
 	2. CSS
 	3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
 	4. FancyBox

 	Testing:

 		Under news section they are buttons to related articles. If pressed they will open up a new tab with related article. 
 	Bootstrap framework was used to create contact page. If you try to submit the contact form without email address, there will be an message showing the invalid email address.  The 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so these are neccesary to submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload.

 	  All the navbar buttons will open related page. My logo when clicked will open up homepage.

 	  I have tried to implement Fancybox framework in this project. The purpose of the feture was supposed to be simple. In picture gallery
 	  every photograp clicked should go to fullscreen mode. Unfortunately that feature didn't work corretly. Photo when clicked was going full 
 	  screen, but after closing it was dissapering from gallery. This issue was addressed my me to Code Institute support. 

 	  The site is fully responsive in different devices. All the layout stays clean and readable via all assortment of viewports.
 	  One of most important features is a navbar menu going to hamburger button on smaller devices. When clicked it opens up buttons to
 	  related pages.

 	  All the gallery items rearrange according to screen size.

 	  Features:

 	  Newsfeed. User is provied with a news tabs. They contain sports and equipment related news topics. When clicked they will open up an article.
 	  Extensive gallery of my images and videos. 
 	  Information about equipment I use.
 	  Contact form . Filled out provides direct contact with me. 

 	  Features to implement:

 	  Make Fancybox gallery fuctional.

 	  Deployment:

 	  This site is will be hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically when new commits are made to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing must be named `index.html` and have a "README.md". 
 
 	  To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/AnestIwata/Milestone.git` into your IDE.
